## Exercises - Value and Reference Types

### Exercise 1: **Identify Value and Reference Types**:  
**Description**: Write a short program that declares and initializes a value type (e.g., `int`) and a reference type (e.g., `class`). Demonstrate the difference in behavior when assigning values between the two.  
**Difficulty**: Easy

---

### Exercise 2: **Pass by Value vs. Reference**:  
**Description**: Write a program that demonstrates passing an `int` (value type) and a `class` (reference type) to methods, modifying them inside the methods, and observing the results in the caller.  
**Difficulty**: Medium

---

### Exercise 3: **Custom Struct**:  
**Description**: Define a custom `struct` called `Vector2D` with `x` and `y` coordinates. Demonstrate how it behaves as a value type by assigning it to another variable and showing that they are independent.  
**Difficulty**: Medium

---

### Exercise 4: **Performance Comparison**:  
**Description**: Create a program that allocates a large number of value type objects (e.g., `int`) and reference type objects (e.g., custom class `GameObject`). Use `Stopwatch` to measure the performance of copying values and references.  
**Difficulty**: Medium

### Exercise 5: **Heap and Stack Memory**:  
**Description**: Explain, using code and comments, how value types and reference types are stored in memory (stack vs. heap). Create a small program to demonstrate this concept.  
**Difficulty**: Medium
